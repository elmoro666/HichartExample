# HichartExample


Repo created to investigate how to properly use react-highcharts unbundled, ie without the bundled version of Highcharts.

clone, npm install

react-highcharts is version 11.0.0 which is bundled with highcharts 5.0.2
highcharts version 4.4.2 is installed.

trying to use react-highcharts unbundled results in both 4.4.2 version and 5.0.2 version being required
